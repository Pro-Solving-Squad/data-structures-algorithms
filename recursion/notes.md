# Recursion

Recursion - A term used for a function that calls itself _until problem is solved_

## Important Steps in a recursive code

1. Identify the base-case
2. Recurse - call the function with an argument that takes you closer to the base case

## Three Values to help visualise Recursion

1. Return Address - Where does the function returns the value to
2. Return Value - Value returned by the function
3. Arguments - values passed into the function

## Recursion steps

1. Pre - you can do something before recursing
2. Recurse - call the function again
3. Post - Steps to do after recursion

## How to read recursive code

1. Identify the base case.
2. Walk through the function for the base case.
3. Identify the case just before the base case.
4. Walk through the function for the case identified on the previous step
5. Repeat this process by identifying the case before the one you just analyzed, and walking though the function for that case

## How to write recursvive code

**Recursion Cartegories:**

1. Repeatedly Execute - the goal of the algorithm was to repeatedly execute a task
2. Calculations - the goal of the algorithm is to perform a calculation based on a subproblem.
   1. Calculations Approaches:
      1. **bottom-up**
      2. **top-down**
         1. Imagine the function you’re writing has already been implemented by
            someone else.
         2. Identify the subproblem of the problem.
         3. See what happens when you call the function on the subproblem and go
            from there.

## When to use Recursion

1. problem can’t be easily solved with a loop
   1. No defined end
   2. There is a branching factor
